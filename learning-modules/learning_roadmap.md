### Additional Notes on GPT
- **Why GPT?**: As a decoder-only transformer, GPT is optimized for generative tasks, making it a natural fit for your GenAI background. Understanding its architecture (self-attention, positional encodings) and training (pre-training on large corpora, fine-tuning) will deepen your ability to integrate it with ML pipelines.
- **Challenges**: GPT models require significant compute for training. Focus on fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-2, DistilGPT-2) to manage resources.
- **Integration with GenAI**: Use GPT in RAG systems by combining its generation capabilities with vector DBs, or in agents by pairing it with ML models for decision-making.
